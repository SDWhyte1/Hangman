Hangman Project -
The purpose is to create a simple 2 player game of hangman using the terminal. One player is the guesser and the other player is the one setting the word.
You are allowed 8 guesses, every wrong guess you lose a life. The guesser is shown letters they have got correctly.
You can choose to play as many times as you like, until you say you no longer want to play at which stage a winner is outputted on the screen.
